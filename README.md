Ace-evil-mc - Ace-mc with evil-mc support
===========================================

[Ace-mc](https://github.com/mm--/ace-mc) can't work with [evil-mc](https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc). So I forked that project and make it. Now it works only under evil-mc, but not multiple-cursors.

Notice that this package isn't completed and has some bugs.

API is as same as ace-mc, I only made a few changes.
