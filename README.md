Ace-evil-mc - Ace-mc with evil-mc support
===========================================

[Ace-mc](https://github.com/mm--/ace-mc) doesn't work with [evil-mc](https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc). So I forked it and added evil-mc support. Now it works only with evil-mc, but not multiple-cursors.

Notice that this package still has some known bugs, which are listed in the [issues page](https://github.com/Liu233w/ace-evil-mc/issues).

The API is as same as which in ace-mc, I only made a few changes.
